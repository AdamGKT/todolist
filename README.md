Technical Choices

This project is a Todo list application built with React Native, Expo, and TypeScript as part of a technical test for GeoRide.

I made the following library choices to focus on code quality, scalability, and developer experience:

React Query

I chose React Query to handle server state and asynchronous logic in a clean and predictable way.
It simplifies data fetching, caching, synchronization, and error handling, while keeping components focused on UI rather than networking logic.

React Native Paper

React Native Paper provides a consistent, accessible, and Material Design–based UI out of the box.
It allows rapid development with well-designed components while keeping the UI clean and professional without spending time on custom styling.

ESLint & Prettier

I used ESLint and Prettier together to enforce consistent code style and best practices.
This ensures readable, maintainable code.
